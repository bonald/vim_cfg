The first public version of pimd-dense is now available 
Pimd-dense is a lightweight, stand-alone PIM-Dense Mode
implementation that may be freely distributed or deployed.  
Pimd-Dense implements the full PIM-DM specification with a few 
noted exceptions (See the release notes).

PimD-Dense is currently ALPHA-version software that still 
requires extensive testing.  If you choose to use it, send any 
comments or bug reports to kurtw@antc.uoregon.edu.

PimD-Dense should compile and run on most UNIX varieties, including
FreeBSD, BSDI, NetBSD, SunOS, IRIX, Solaris 2.5, Solaris 2.6, and Linux
(however it has not yet been tested on all these).

The software and information may be obtained from the website of
the University of Oregon's Advanced Network Technology Center (ANTC).
