 * December 30, 1998
   Fixed entry timer initialization in route.c:process_cache_miss()

 * December 22, 1998
   Synch'ed with latest releave pimd (sparse) from USC:

   - XXX Timer changes in defs.h compatible with entry/prune timeout changes?

   - BUG FIX: fix TIMEOUT definitions in difs.h (bug report by Nidhi Bhaskar)
     (originally, if timer value less than 5 seconds, it won't become 0)
   - (Almost) all timers manipulation now use macros
   - pim.h and pim_var.h are in separate common directory
   - added BSDI definition to pim_var.h (thanks to Hitoshi Adaeda)
   - Now compiles under Linux (haven't check whether the PIMv2 kernel
     support in linux-2.1.103 works)
   - allpimrouters deleted from igmp.c (already defined in pim.c)
   - igmpmsg defined for IRIX 

 * December 21, 1998
   Linux patches to pim.c and defs.h 
   (contributed by Jonathan Day <j.c.day@larc.nasa.gov>)

   Notes from Jonathan:
   I'd like to report some bugs in the current version of PimD-Dense, which
   cause compilation to fail under Linux. In defs.h, external variables that
   have already been defined are being re-defined, causing the compilation to
   fail. In pim.c, there is a typing error - if->ip_len is referred to, as
   opposed to ip->ip_len. I've included the changes I've been using to fix
   these bugs.

 * December 21, 1998
   Fixed delay time for LAN prune scheduling to 4 seconds to comply
   with spec, which says that prunes should be delayed for time
   strictly greater than the maximum join delay of 3 seconds.

 * December 21, 1998
   Fixed Prune timeout behavior:
   - Prune timeout now triggers graft
   - If prune and entry timeout simultaneously, the prune is timed out
     first, triggering an entry timer refresh.

 * December 21, 1998
   Fixed Assert sending so that asserts sent from upstream routers
   without routes to the source send pref and metric of 0x7fffffff.

 * June 19, 1998
   Modifications to comply with the latest PIM-DM spec revision:
   - Graft retransmission period is now 3 seconds
   - Random Join/Prune delay is 3 seconds
   Some still unresolved issues:
   - Upstream Address field in Graft and Graft-Ack

 * Version 0.2.1.0-alpha15, May 29, 1998
   Synched in fixes from Pavlin's pimd-2.1.0-alpha15:
   - few bug fixes related to NetBSD definitions 
     (thanks to Heiko W.Rupp <hwr@pilhuhn.de>)
   - MRT_PIM completely replaced by MRT_ASSERT

 * Version 0.2.1.0-alpha11, May 29, 1998
   This is the first release of the the PIM Dense-Mode version of pimd.
   For now, I have simply prepended "0." onto the version number for 
   Pavlin Ivanov Radoslavov's Sparse-Mode pimd, from which this code 
   was derived.  A new 1.0.x-alpha version number will be assigned 
   upon the initial public release of this code.
