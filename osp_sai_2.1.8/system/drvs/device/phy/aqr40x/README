Upgrading between AQ_API versions
---
1. 
  Details of changes in each release version made can be found in the file: 
docs/AQ_API_Change_Log.txt

2. 
  Initial integration of AQ_API for a particular platform typically
involves implementing a few platform-specific functions, and ensuring that
the proper set of preprocessor symbols are defined.  For more information, 
please refer to the "Platform Interface" section of the design guide PDF
file (in docs).  
  The copy of include/AQ_User.h contains default choices of which 
preprocessor symbols to define.  But note that if this file was edited when
initial integration was done for the old release version, those changes
should be brought forward when integrating the new release version.  
In this case, the AQ_User.h file distributed with the new version can 
simply be overwritten with the edited copy from the older version.
  In particular, if basic functionality that was working properly using
the older version no longer works in the new version, please ensure that
AQ_PHY_SUPPORTS_BLOCK_READ_WRITE is defined/undefined as appropriate for 
the platform.
